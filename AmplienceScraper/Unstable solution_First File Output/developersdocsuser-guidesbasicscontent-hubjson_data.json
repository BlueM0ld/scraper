It underpins the services of Dynamic Media, which includes powerful features for manipulating images and video, and acts as the assets library for assets used in Dynamic Content.All of this is augmented by our CDN (Content Delivery Network) infrastructure.In this section we'll provide an introduction to Content Hub, what it does and how to get started with using it. For more detailed information about how to perform specific tasks, see Managing assets.You can also visit the Content Hub videos page for some tutorial videos that walk you through the key features covered in this section.Content Hub main assets screenLink copied!When you log in to Content Hub, you will see the main Content Hub assets screen from which you can manage assets.At the top of the window is the toolbar for quick access to bulk actions, and settings for displaying assets. On the left are icons for four sections: Organise, Filters, Tools and Apps as highlighted below.When the Organise or Filters sections are in focus, assets are shown in the main display area. Each asset is represented by an asset card, from which you can perform contextual actions and access the Properties pane.Content Hub toolbarLink copied!The icons on the left of the toolbar allow bulk preview (1 in the image below), publish (2), unpublish (3) and delete (4) for up to 200 selected assets.The toolbar bulk action icons will be highlighted depending on whether an action, such as unpublish, can be performed on the current selection.selecting assets for bulk actionsTo select a range of assets, click the first one to select it and then shift-click on the last asset in the chosen range.

Within asset stores, assets are organized into folders and subfolders. Only the asset stores that a user has permission to view will be displayed in this section.From the Organize section you can do the following:Search for assets, using search criteria to refine the search results. From here you can also filter which asset types you want displayed.Browse and organize assets using asset stores, folders, sub folders. Click on an asset store or folder to work with the assets assigned to it.Filter which assets are shown. This section provides quick access for setting filters. Note, if you are using image recognition, filters are also shown for detected data types. See Image recognition.Asset searchLink copied!The search functionality within Content Hub allows you to build up powerful searches, including AND, OR and NOT, together with wildcards.For example, the following search query: \"hat AND stripe*\", returns assets that either have names containing 'hat' or names containing any text starting with 'stripe'.Note the search is performed for the selected asset store or folder, and its sub folders. To search all asset stores and their folders, select \"All Assets\".For full information about how to define advanced searches, see the Searching for assets page.Filters sectionLink copied!From the Filters section you can filter the displayed assets using various asset attributes.
