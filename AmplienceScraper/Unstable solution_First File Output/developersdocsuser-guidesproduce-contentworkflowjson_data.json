On this page we'll provide an overview of these features and include links to pages that go into each feature in more detail.Content statusLink copied!Content statuses can be used to indicate the status or progress of content, and support workflows, such as translation, in your content production process. You can define up to 100 statuses per hub and give each its own label and color.Adding and editing content statusesLink copied!To add, view and edit a content status, choose \"Status\" from the settings menu.infoIf the status feature is not available on your hub, contact your Customer Success Manager to have it enabled.The \"Status settings\" window is displayed for you to manage up to 100 statuses for a hub. In the example below we've defined a set of statuses to support a translation workflow.To add a new status click the \"+\" icon. Give the item a label and choose a color. In this example we're adding a status of \"Image review\".When you've entered a label and color, click the Save icon to the right of the color.To edit an existing status, change its label or color and click the Save icon. Any changes you make to the name or color of a status will be propagated to any items that already use the status.noteIt's not currently possible to delete a status.Setting a status for contentLink copied!Once statuses are set up for a hub, they can be used to track the progress of content through a workflow. To do this, you set statuses for content items and slots. Statuses do not enforce any functionality and are simply a visual guide.Setting a status for a single itemLink copied!To set the status for an item in the content form (shown below) or in the content library, you use the \"Status\" menu. When you create a new content item and save it, you can set a status from the \"Save\" dialog.When you set a status from the content library, if an item doesn't have a status, hover the cursor over the item to display the \"Status\" menu.Setting a status for multiple itemsLink copied!To set a status for multiple items, select them in the content library and choose a status. To quickly select all displayed items, use \"Select all\". See Performing bulk actions.This example shows setting a status for multiple items in grid view.Filtering content by statusLink copied!You can filter the content library to show content with selected statuses only, for example, to show only content that requires translation.In this example, the Draft status is selected, so only items with this status are displayed.Assigning content itemsLink copied!You can assign content items to yourself or to one or more other users and filter the Content Library by assignee. This allows you to focus on just those content items that you need to work on.Assignees can be added from an item's contextual menu in the Content Library or from the content form, as shown below.To assign a content item, or change the assignees, choose \"Assign to\" from the item's contextual menu. You can assign the item to yourself as well as to one or more other users. Note that the current user is always shown as \"Me\".From the assign to window you can choose from a list of recent users to whom you've assigned content, or find another user by typing their name in the search box, as shown in the example below.Assign the content item to a user by clicking the checkbox next to their name and un-assign the item by deselecting the checkbox.You can also assign a content item from the content form by clicking the assign icon, as shown below.Item assignees are shown in Content Library and are represented by a user's gravatar if they have one, or an icon of their first name and a color chosen at random from a standard set of colors.Hovering over the assigned to icon will display a popup with the full name of each assignee.When viewing content as a grid, the assignee icon is shown on each item's card.Filtering the content library by assigneeLink copied!You can filter the content library by assignee by clicking the \"Filters\" icon. This allows you to focus on the content items that you, or other users, are working on. The assignee filter can be combined with other filters such as content status, so you could choose to list items that are marked with a status of \"In Review\" and which are assigned to the selected user or users.In the example below we're filtering on items assigned to the current user (\"Me\") with a status of \"In Review\".The view of the content will be updated to match the chosen filters.Assigning an item on SaveLink copied!One way of enhancing your workflow is to assign one or more assignees when you save a content item. In the example below a content item will be assigned to two users when it is saved.Item propertiesLink copied!Assignees are also shown in the item properties pane and reflected in the item's revision history. In the properties pane, the assignee icon and full name are shown and \"Me\" is used for the current user.Assigning a content item will be listed in the item's revision history but will not generate a new version of the item.Related pagesLink copied!Revision historyPreviousOrganizing contentNextPublishing contentContent statusAdding and editing content statusesSetting a status for contentFiltering content by statusAssigning content itemsFiltering the content library by assigneeAssigning an item on SaveItem propertiesRelated pagesProductsWhy AmplienceDynamic ContentContent HubDynamic MediaIntegration MarketplaceMACH AllianceRequest TrialProduct StatusResourcesBlogDocumentationCompareReports & WhitepapersWebinars & VideosPlaygroundSupportRegister a DealKey conceptsHeadless CMSHeadless CommerceComposable CommerceAgile CMSJavascript CMSReact CMSNext.js CMSJamstack CMSCompanyAboutContactCustomersPartnersCareersTerms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyHeadless Content and Commerce Simplified\u00a9 2023 Amplience.
