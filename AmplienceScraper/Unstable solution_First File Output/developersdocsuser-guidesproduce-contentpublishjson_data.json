When a content item is published, the publish status is shown on the item's card, with a green tick indicating that the latest version is published.When an item is published, any assets contained within it and each linked content item is published at the same time. This includes media such as images or video included within the content and other content items that this item contains. For example, if you have a carousel that contains individual carousel slides, each stored as separate content items, each of these slides will be published with the carousel.If more than one content item is published as a result of publishing the 'parent' item, then you will need to refresh the content library window for the publishing status of the linked items to be updated.For more information about how you can use the publishing feature to update content previously published to a slot in an edition see the updating content published to slots page.Publishing from the Content LibraryLink copied!In the example below, we want to publish the \"Winter collection banner\" content item, so we choose \"Publish\" from the item's menu.A dialog is displayed asking to confirm the publish operation.On clicking the Publish button, the publishing operation starts. A progress indicator is displayed in the top left of the item being published.When the item is published the publish status icon is updated to a green tick. The latest version of the content item is now published to our Content Delivery Network (CDN) and available to consume in a website or from an app or e-commerce system. This will replace any previous published version of the content.Publishing from the content formLink copied!You can also publish content from the content form. The \"Save\" menu contains an item named \"Save and publish\" if the content has been changed since it was last saved, or \"Publish\" if it doesn't need saving. In the example below, we're saving and then publishing a carousel.A confirmation dialog is shown. Click \"Publish\" to continue. A progress indicator is shown while the publish is in progress.When the content item is published, the publish icon changes to a green tick.Publishing linked contentLink copied!When you publish linked content such as a carousel, all of the content linked to the content item is published as well. In the example shown below, we're publishing the \"Summer special collection carousel\".Choose \"Publish\" from the content item's menu and click \"Print\" on the confirmation dialog to confirm the publish.A progress indicator is shown on the card for the carousel while the publish is in progress.When the carousel is published, the icon changes to a green tick.The carousel slides have been published as well, but to see their updated publish status, you need to refresh the screen.The publish status of summer slides 1 to 4 is now shown as a green tick.Related pagesLink copied!Adding a delivery keyPreviousDefining a simple content workflowNextWorking with scheduled contentPublishing from the Content LibraryPublishing from the content formPublishing linked contentRelated pagesProductsWhy AmplienceDynamic ContentContent HubDynamic MediaIntegration MarketplaceMACH AllianceRequest TrialProduct StatusResourcesBlogDocumentationCompareReports & WhitepapersWebinars & VideosPlaygroundSupportRegister a DealKey conceptsHeadless CMSHeadless CommerceComposable CommerceAgile CMSJavascript CMSReact CMSNext.js CMSJamstack CMSCompanyAboutContactCustomersPartnersCareersTerms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyHeadless Content and Commerce Simplified\u00a9 2023 Amplience.
