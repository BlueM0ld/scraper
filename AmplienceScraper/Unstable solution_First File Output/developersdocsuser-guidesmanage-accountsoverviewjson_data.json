With our account management you have the freedom to control access for Dynamic Content users, and the actions they can perform. Using account management, administrators can set user permissions for content in your account structure, that is, your organizations, hubs and repositories.\nSetting permissions with account managementRoles are the replacement for personas as the way of managing access to Dynamic Content. Contact Amplience support or Customer Success about migrating to roles.Get startedLink copied!Account management lets you set permissions for Dynamic Content users yourself, rather than making requests to Amplience support.In account management, user access to Dynamic Content hubs and repositories is managed using:Organizations, hubs and repositories - This is the structure in which your content is organized. With account management, you work in the context of an organization. See Account structure.Members and teams - Users must be \"members\" of organizations to access content, and can be grouped into teams. See Managing members and teams.Roles - Roles are the way of setting permissions for members and teams to access hubs, repositories and content within an organization. See Setting permissions.We provide a standard set of roles to streamline the process of setting permissions on a per hub, per repository basis. The roles are summarized below:Admin - can perform all actions for an organization, hub or repositoryDeveloper - can perform actions that enable other users to create and manage content on a hub or repositoryPublisher - can manage editions and events to schedule content on the appropriate hubs, and publish contentAuthor - can create, archive and delete content in the appropriate hubs and repositories, but not publish contentMember - can view events, editions and content but not manage or publish anythinginfoRoles are the replacement for personas as the way of managing access to Dynamic Content.

Your Customer Success manager will contact you to inform you when your account will be updated to take advantage of Account Management. The migration process is outlined in How to migrate.infoRoles are replacing personas over time. If you currently use personas to control access for Dynamic Content users, please contact your Amplience Customer Success Manager or Amplience support to discuss migrating to roles.Benefits of migrating to rolesLink copied!The benefits of migrating to roles include:Flexible, granular user permissions - Administrators use roles to set permissions on a per hub, per repository basis, so users only see the content they need. In comparison, personas were set at hub level and inherited by all child repositories.Streamlined user role allocation \u2013 Save time by assigning roles at a team level\nrather than individual basis.Simplified login to hubs - With organizations as containers for hubs and repositories, users may use the same login account to access different Dynamic Content hubs belonging to other organizations, rather than having different login accounts.Single account access to Dynamic Content and Content Hub \u2013 When used with\nthe Assets Tab in Dynamic Content, the need for alias accounts is removed because Dynamic Content users no longer require a matching Content Hub account to upload assets.How to migrate to rolesLink copied!You will be migrated to using roles by your 'Amplience account team', which may include your Customer Success Manager, Amplience Support or both. The migration process is simple and outlined below. Amplience will identify your organization administrator, who will be the person responsible for managing user permissions in the future. You can change the organization administrator and easily add additional ones.Your Amplience account team can provide a template to help your administrator inform users about the change.The Amplience account team will:Set up the initial organization administrator for your environment. Remember, you can change and add organization administratorsMigrate the persona permissions for each user to their corresponding rolesRemove the persona permissionsSend invites to the users for them to start working with their rolesYour administrator will be able to see the invited users and their permissions in the Account Management panel. Users should continue to work as usual because the roles map closely to the old personas. (See How personas map to roles.Validate your users have the required access and permissions:Once migrated, all users receive an invitation. Users who log in using single sign-on (SSO) automatically accept their invitation by logging in. Users who don't use SSO, must accept their invitation email before they can access the Amplience platform. If the invitation gets lost, or isn't received for any other reason, your administrator can resend the invitation from the Account Management panel. If an invitation expires, it must be resent by Amplience Support.If users require different permissions, your administrator can now directly adjust these using the Account Management panel.
