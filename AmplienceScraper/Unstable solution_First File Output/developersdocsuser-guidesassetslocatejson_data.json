When you work with assets, whether you are using Content Hub or Dynamic Content, you will see that your assets are organized into asset stores and folders.By creating a clear structure you will be able to easily navigate to your assets.Understand how to use search criteria to narrow down the number of assets that are found when you do a search. You may be in the position where you need to find assets that someone else has created and you are unfamiliar with their folder structure. In this case, knowing you to make full use of the search feature can be very useful.Know how the filter feature works, to reduce the number of files that are displayed. Typically your organization will have a vast number of assets and you don't need them all displayed for all of the time. Use the filter feature in Content Hub so that you are working with a manageable number of assets.When you are working with localized variants of assets, you can use locales and localizations to organize your assets to serve localized variants of an asset for different countries and regions.Use media share to make assets stored within Amplience available to a targeted audience for a specified duration, via a publicly accessible URLFind and restore to earlier versions of assets. Some actions, such as publishing, result in a new version of an asset being created, allowing you to return to previous versions.Related pagesLink copied!Organizing assetsSearching for and filtering assetsWorking with asset localesShare media via a publicly accessible URLFind earlier versions of assetsPreviousUploading assetsNextOrganizing assetsRelated pagesProductsWhy AmplienceDynamic ContentContent HubDynamic MediaIntegration MarketplaceMACH AllianceRequest TrialProduct StatusResourcesBlogDocumentationCompareReports & WhitepapersWebinars & VideosPlaygroundSupportRegister a DealKey conceptsHeadless CMSHeadless CommerceComposable CommerceAgile CMSJavascript CMSReact CMSNext.js CMSJamstack CMSCompanyAboutContactCustomersPartnersCareersTerms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyHeadless Content and Commerce Simplified\u00a9 2023 Amplience.
