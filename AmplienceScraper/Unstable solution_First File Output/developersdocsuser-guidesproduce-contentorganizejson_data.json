To organize your content further, you can create folders inside repositories. This is useful if you want to keep the content for different projects separate from each other, making it easy to find all the content for a particular project.The content library windowLearn more about the content library window, including understanding the icons, and how to find, sort and filter content.Adding foldersLink copied!Folders are added within a repository. To create a new folder, right click on the folder to which it should be added and choose \"Add subfolder\" from the menu. You can also add a folder at the top level of a repository by right clicking the repository name and choosing \"Add subfolder\".A text edit box appears allowing you to give the new folder a name. Enter the new name, and type return. In this example a new folder is created called \"Winter outerwear\" within the \"Winter\" folder.You can also add a subfolder to within another folder from the folder list at the top of the window. Right click on the folder within which you want to add a sub folder. In the example shown below, a subfolder is added to the \"Collections\" folder.You can add a folder at the current level of the folder structure by clicking the \"+\" icon. In the image below, we're choosing to add a folder at the top level of the repository.Moving content into a folderLink copied!To move content into a folder, simply select one or more items, by clicking anywhere within the item's card, and drag the content into the chosen folder. When an item is selected, the checkbox on the bottom right of the item's card is checked. When viewing your content in list view, the checkbox is shown on the left of the content item's name.In this example, 2 items are selected.As you drag the items, the number of items you're moving will be shown. In the example below, we're dragging the selected items to the \"Winter outerwear\" folder.The items have now been moved to the \"Winter outerwear\" folder.Renaming a folderLink copied!To rename a folder, hover over the folder title until the ellipsis menu appears and right-click and choose \"Rename\". In this example we've chosen to rename the \"Winter outerwear\" folder.The rename folder dialog is displayed allowing you to enter a new name. In this example we'll rename the folder to \"Winter outerwear collection\". Press \"Rename\" to apply the name change.The folder is now renamed to \"Winter outerwear collection\".Deleting a folderLink copied!To delete a folder choose the \"Delete item\" from the folder's menu. In this example we are deleting the \"Winter outerwear collection\" folder.You will be asked to confirm the deletion.An error warns that the \"Winter collection collection\" folder is not empty and cannot be deleted. Only empty folders can be deleted, so in order to delete this folder you would need to drag all the items into another folder or the top level of the repository.Archiving and unarchiving contentLink copied!To help you manage and organize your content, you can move any content items and slots you no longer need, to the archive folder at the root level of their respective repositories. Archiving content does not permanently delete it and you can browse and unarchive content if you need to continue to work with it.Archiving contentLink copied!Archiving content does not affect any previous work you have done with the content:If the content is published, the published version is still consumed as normalAny versions of the content that have been saved to an edition are still available to add to slots and scheduled for publicationArchived content can no longer be edited, published or copied and does not show up in any search resultsTo archive items, you can:Archive an item from the content library - Choose \"Archive\" from the item's contextual menu Archive an item from the content form - Choose 'Archive' from the content form Save menuArchive multiple items - Select the items in the content library, then click \"Archive selected items\" in the toolbar. Tip, to select all items on a page use the \"Select all\" option. See Performing bulk actionsIn this example, we've selected 4 items to archive. This displays the \"Archive selected items\" icon in the toolbar. Click the icon to archive the items.The items are moved from the current folder (\"Summer\") to the archive.The items are moved to the archive folder at the root level of the repository. You can still view the items and their revision history from within the archive folder, but they can no longer be modified. If you decide to continue to work with content, then it must be unarchived.Archiving linked contentLink copied!If you archive a content item that is part of a piece of linked content, for example a carousel slide that is added to a carousel, then the archived item will be shown as 'archived' on the editing screen for the parent item. Any item containing archived content cannot be published or saved to an edition.In the example below, the girl in a red coat image is archived.When the content form for the \"Winter is coming\" carousel is displayed, the \"Red coat in the snow\" image is marked as archived. The item can still be viewed or deleted from the carousel, but publishing the carousel item or saving it to an edition will fail.If you open the archived content and unarchive it, then the carousel can be successfully published.Unarchiving contentLink copied!To unarchive individual or multiple items, do one of the following:Unarchive an individual content item - Choose \"Unarchive\" from the chosen item's contextual menu in the content libraryUnarchive an item that's open in the content form - Choose 'Unarchive'Unarchive multiple items - Select the items and then click the \"Unarchive selected items\" icon in the toolbar. See Performing bulk actionsIn the example below, we have opened the \"Red coat in the snow\" content item from the Archive folder. Notice that the date and time when the content was archived is shown in the revision history.To unarchive the item, click the 'Unarchive' button.The item is successfully unarchived and is moved back to its original folder. In this case it's returned to the root level of the repository.To unarchive an item from the content library, navigate to the Archive folder, then choose \"Unarchive\" from the item's contextual menu. In this example, the \"Girl in hat\" item will be restored to its previous location in the content library.Archiving slotsLink copied!Slots can also be archived in the same way as content, by selecting a slot item in the slot library and choosing \"Archive\" from the contextual menu.To quickly archive multiple slotsFrom the content library, select the slots to archive and then select the \"Archive\" icon in the toolbar. Note, the \"Archive\" icon becomes visible when items are selected. See Performing bulk actions.In the example below, the \"home page hero slot\" item would be moved to the \"Archive\" folder at the top level of the slots repository.Archived slots do not show up in the slot browser when adding slots to an edition. An edition that has already been scheduled and contains one or more slots that are later archived can be published, but you will not be able to schedule an edition containing archived slots.See Adding content to slots and Scheduling an edition for more information about adding slots and scheduling an edition.PreviousContent Revision HistoryNextDefining a simple content workflowAdding foldersMoving content into a folderRenaming a folderDeleting a folderArchiving and unarchiving contentArchiving contentUnarchiving contentArchiving slotsProductsWhy AmplienceDynamic ContentContent HubDynamic MediaIntegration MarketplaceMACH AllianceRequest TrialProduct StatusResourcesBlogDocumentationCompareReports & WhitepapersWebinars & VideosPlaygroundSupportRegister a DealKey conceptsHeadless CMSHeadless CommerceComposable CommerceAgile CMSJavascript CMSReact CMSNext.js CMSJamstack CMSCompanyAboutContactCustomersPartnersCareersTerms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyHeadless Content and Commerce Simplified\u00a9 2023 Amplience.
