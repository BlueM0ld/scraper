When you perform a search, you look into the records of an Algolia index.', 'In relational databases, you distribute data across different tables. You break information into small, meaningful units to avoid redundancy. With Algolia, these principles don’t matter. As seen earlier, with record structure and data hierarchy, flattened data is best for searching. This applies at the index level too. It’s a good approach to create several indices and map them to your tables, where each index represents a different kind of entity. For example, you may want to separate movies from actors and create an index for each. However, this might not serve the purposes of your search. What if you want your users to search for both movies and actors simultaneously and for them to appear in the same results? In that case, a single index works better.', 'The main reason for this is relevance. Algolia searches one index at a time: it doesn’t perform cross-index searches. Searching two indices produces two sets of results, each with a dedicated relevance configuration. Algolia doesn’t merge these results, and trying to do this yourself would break the relevance (since combining Algolia’s results after a search requires understanding and re-implementing Algolia’s ranking algorithm). You would be undoing all the work that Algolia does for you.', 'It doesn’t mean that there are no reasons for having multiple indices but splitting data per entity isn’t one of them.', 'Your user interface needs usually determine ', '. For example, if you want your search experience to display movies and actors separately, it’s better to use different indices.', 'Use separate indices when:', 'High on the list of relevance tuning is ', '. When two records rank the same based on textual relevance, you want to tie break based on meaningful metrics, such as popularity, number of views, or sales. Including business metrics in your records is crucial to creating a relevant search experience.', 'It’s a good idea to start thinking about such metrics when fetching your data and structuring your records.', 'Including attributes for ', ' and faceting helps with relevance because it helps users refine their search and narrow down results. As well as using the categories from your data, you can reuse your searchable or ranking data to create new filters and facets. Going back to the movie example, you can use numeric attributes like ', ' to display a range filter on the frontend or string attributes like ', ' to refine movies nationally.', 'A good rule of thumb is to ', '. If you’re selling movies online, useful categories include distribution systems (such as DVD, Blu-Ray, Video on Demand) or content rating (such as PG, PG-13). If you have a movie reviews website, users likely want to refine on review score or popularity.', 'Algolia provides a vast collection of settings to help with relevance, and many of these work in combination with how you format your content.

In the search and discovery context, businesses consider product reviews to be as relevant as product descriptions. Both are relevant for matching users’ queries.', 'Algolia’s ', ' feature enables you to use business signals such as the number of sales and profit margins. You can also use ratings to influence the ranking. For example, when a user types a broad query such as “headphones”, a ratings-based custom ranking ensures that the highest-rated earbuds show up first.', 'Though this tutorial focuses on star ratings, this solution can work with any product scoring system. For example, you could compute the Bayesian average for the number of up and down votes, or scores based on the number of sells or views.', 'The first sections in this guide explain the challenges with star ratings and how the Bayesian average has become the preferred method for ranking by star ratings. If you like, you can ', '.', 'Creating a meaningful ranking strategy based on ratings can be challenging. Is only one rating enough? Or do you need a certain quantity of ratings for the ratings to be reliable? Is a product that receives many mixed ratings, with a range between 1 and 5 (in a 5-star rating system), better than a product with a smaller number of mostly positive ratings? Obviously, a product that receives only 5 stars is a good choice, but is it better than a popular item with hundreds of 4 stars?', 'A good example is the query “lion” on a movie streaming site. Should the movie “The Lion King” rank above a higher rated but lesser known film like “The Lion in Winter”? Suppose that “The Lion King” has an average of 4.5 stars but “The Lion in Winter” has a higher average of 4.8. If the 4.5 average rating comes from 10,000 ratings and the 4.8 average rating from 100 ratings, which movie should show up first?\\n', 'The challenge with any rating system—whether for handbags, electronics, or movies—is that the ', ' of ratings is as important as the rating itself. Intuitively, the more ratings received, the more confidence you can have in the rating. But again, how many ratings do you need to have confidence that the rating is meaningful?', 'Consider two ways to rank star ratings:', 'As already suggested, ignoring the quantity of ratings doesn’t help distinguish between items with 10 ratings and 1000 ratings. You need to at least calculate an average that includes the quantity of ratings.', 'The following image shows three items ranked by different averages. The left side uses the arithmetic average for ranking. The right side uses the Bayesian average.', 'Both sides display the arithmetic average in parenthesis just right of the stars. They also display the average used for ranking as ', ' and ', ' respectively, under each item.', 'By putting Item A at the top, the left side’s ranking is both misleading and unsatisfying. The ranking on the right, based on the Bayesian average, reflects a better balance of rating and quantity of ratings. This example shows how the Bayesian average lowered item A’s average to 4.3 because it measured A’s 10 ratings against B and C’s much larger numbers of ratings. As described later, the Bayesian average left Items B and C unchanged because the Bayesian average affects items with low rating counts much more then those that have more ratings.', 'In sum, by relativizing ratings in this way, the Bayesian average creates a more reliable comparison between products. It ensures that products with lower numbers of ratings have less weight in the ranking. What follows is a description of the Bayesian average and how to code it.', 'The Bayesian average adjusts the average rating of products whose rating counts fall below a threshold. Suppose the threshold amount is calculated to be 100. That means average ratings with less than 100 ratings get adjusted, while average ratings with more than 100 ratings change only very slightly. This threshold amount of 100 is called a ', ', because it gives you confidence that averages with 100 or more ratings are more reliable than averages with less than 100 ratings.', 'This confidence number derives from the catalog’s distribution of rating counts and the average rating of all products. By factoring in ratings counts and averages from the whole catalog, the Bayesian average has the following effect on an item’s individual average rating:', 'The Bayesian average uses two constants to offset the arithmetic average of an individual product:', 'The calculation for ', ' is a straightforward ', ' for all products: ', '.', 'Calculating ', ' requires a bit more math. This tutorial calculates ', ' based on the distribution of the rating counts for each product, where ', ' is equal to the 25% percentile (= the lower ', '). For example, suppose a store has 100 products. To compute ', ', you take all the products and sort them by the quantity of ratings each has. Some have 10 ratings and others have 100 or 1000 ratings. Once sorted, you find the product at the 25% position on the sorted list and look at how many ratings it has. This is the lower quartile for ', '. For simplicity, this guide sets ', '.', 'Thus, if you calculate the overall average rating (', ') of the store’s catalog to be 3.5, the Bayesian average uses both of these values ( ', ' and ', ') to adjust the arithmetic average. It does this using the following formula:', 'Here’s the same formula with the example numbers plugged in:', 'This section shows how to code the Bayesian constants (', ' and ', ') and the Bayesian average itself. It also discusses when to calculate these values.', 'You need a dataset of products where each product has at least these three attributes:', 'Here’s a sample dataset.', 'This JSON already includes a ', ' attribute.

As suggested in the preceding section, you can use a lower quartile % that corresponds to the 25% percentile. You can calculate this value using the following SQL function:', 'The syntax of this SQL function can differ from one SQL database to another, so you might need to adapt it.', 'You may also want to calculate separate constants for each product category. This is helpful for use cases with multiple categories of items, like Amazon and other marketplaces.', 'The variables ', ' and ', ' match the attributes in the index that represent, respectively, the rating average and quantity of ratings for each product:', 'First, create a function that calculates the Bayesian average. Using all four variables, this function generates the Bayesian average for a single product:', 'Next, perform the calculations for every product. You can do this by:', 'The full example looks like this:', 'As users rate products, their Bayesian average changes—but not necessarily with every new rating. Here’s some guidance on how often to update the Bayesian average.', 'For ', ', you can create a batch job that runs once a week or month. These constants don’t need to change that often.', 'It’s important to store these constants so that you can calculate all products based on the same constants. Thus, whenever you change these constants, you should recalculate every product’s Bayesian average.', 'For ', ', you can recalculate the Bayesian average periodically during the day, every night, or even weekly. It all depends on how many ratings you get on a daily basis. For example, Uber might want to update their drivers’ averages several times a day, whereas Amazon might be fine with an overnight process, or even weekly. Essentially, the more often people rate your products, the more often you should update the Bayesian average.', 'Because the Bayesian calculation is an average, the values don’t change with every new rating. Thus, it’s usually not necessary to recalculate with every new rating. You can recalculate Bayesian averages whenever you update your product index. Note that because the Bayesian average affects one attribute per record, you can do a ', ' to change only the Bayesian average attribute.', 'As you’ve seen, you add the Bayesian average attribute to every product. It’s used as a ', ' attribute to rank records by ratings. There are several considerations when using the Bayesian average as a custom ranking. For example:', 'Up to this point, the assumption is that the Bayesian average operates alone in ranking your results. In that case, you can use the new ', ' attribute you’ve added in each of your records as a custom ranking value, as seen in the following image:', 'More often, you want to add a ', ' ranking criteria as a tie-breaker, to handle cases where two or more results have the same Bayesian average. In these cases, you can use typical business metrics, such as most sales, views, margins, or anything else.', 'For example, if you have ten records with a Bayesian average of 4, you need a second custom ranking to break the tie between these 4’s. Here’s an example where a product’s ', ' acts as a secondary tie-breaker for the primary Bayesian average ranking:', 'You may want to round your scores to one of the 5 ratings (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5), or more granularly (0.5, 1, 1.5, …, 5), by using ', '. This avoids impacting the ranking with insignificant differences between products. For example, you may decide that products with the Bayesian averages of 3.15 and 3.16 should have the same ranking.', 'You can also group ratings. For example, you can put products with a Bayesian average between 3.8 and 4.2 into one group with a rating of 4, products with averages between 4.3 and 4.7 into another group with rating 4.5, and so forth.', 'Not every group needs to have the same range. For example, one group can contain ratings between 1 and 2, whereas another group can contain ratings between 3 and 3.5, etc. This is helpful when your product ratings are unevenly distributed, for example, many more 3’s than 1’s. Grouping is another name for ', ', which not only removes insignificant differences between products, but tailors the grouping to your precise business needs or dataset.', 'While using Bayesian averages is an excellent way to rank results, it might be too simplistic depending on the size or nature of your business. Some businesses change the way they compute an “average star rating.”', 'For example, they may incorporate other signals into their average, such as weighing reviews from validated reviewers differently, or excluding reviews that have less than five likes, or removing high and low ratings that deviate too much from the average (assuming your ratings follow a bell curve, which most do.)', 'In sum, whether it be with rounding, grouping, or using multiple indicators, you’re improving upon the already more reliable Bayesian average, thereby creating an even more reliable indicator of favorite products.', 'Feel free to share other methods you’ve used to assess the level of enthusiasm for your individual products.

A user’s behavior implicitly reveals their preferences and interests—what Algolia refers to as “affinities.” This guide explains how Algolia calculates user affinities based on user behavior and how user affinity scores are applied to results.', 'Basing Personalization on individual items is inefficient. Users tend to have affinities not for particular items but rather for categories of items.', 'For example, a user can have an affinity for athletic wear while shopping for clothing, non-fiction works when browsing through books, or pop music when listening to music. These different categories correlate with ', ' in your data. Thus, to personalize search results, Algolia’s engine needs to understand which categories, that is, facets, your user has an affinity for. ', 'Take an online media store as an example. To personalize search results, it’s more important to know the genres, authors, and artists behind the media a user has consumed, rather than the individual titles. When the engine knows the categories a user likes, it can personalize results based on these affinities. It does so by boosting the corresponding facets values.', 'For example, imagine a user who purchased children’s books and other media in the past. Suppose they search for “poetry.” In that case, the engine can return book results from Shel Silverstein, Dr. Seuss, and other children’s poets. For another user who has shown an affinity for Korean film, it can boost the 2010 Korean drama “Poetry” for this search. In both cases, textual relevance is the first step, but personalizing results depends on the facets involved in the user’s past behavior.', 'Users’ behaviors, both search and non-search related, give insight into their affinities. Examples of meaningful behavior are whenever a user views, clicks on, likes, favorites, bookmarks, or purchases a particular item or category. When a user interacts with a particular item or category, the engine considers the facet values that represent the item or category to understand the user’s affinities.', 'User behavior reaches Algolia in the form of standardized events. ', ' To build the most nuanced and relevant user profiles, it’s necessary to gather as much data as possible.', 'To help you decide which events matter, read the ', ' guide. Without a large set of user data and a well-considered ', ', Personalization can lead to the wholesale promotion of some categories over others', 'There are three layers of scoring in Personalization: sending events, building user affinity profiles based on facets, and applying the profiles based on your ', '.', 'Building user affinities begins with collecting events. Though you may collect a wide variety of events, for example, viewing a category page, clicking on a product page, liking an item, sharing an item, and adding an item to the shopping cart, it’s unlikely that each of these events should have the same weight when personalizing results. For example, adding an item to the shopping cart is likely a stronger indicator of affinity than viewing its product detail page. ', '.', 'After setting your strategy and simulating, you may also decide that certain events don’t offer any meaningful information. That’s alright—just because you’ve collected certain events doesn’t mean you need to include them all in your strategy.', 'Though events can be item-based or category-based, Algolia always extracts the underlying facets to build user affinity profiles. The engine stores all underlying facet information gathered from events so that you can simulate the effects of including different facets in your ', '. ', 'For example, a clothing store may have listed category, color, price, brand, material, and size as ', ' to let users filter on them when searching. However, just because a user buys a green sweater, it doesn’t mean they’ll buy green items from now on. While brand, category, and size are probably strong indicators of a user’s affinities, color may be less so. Just like with events, you can set the each facet’s weight within your ', ' or leave them out altogether.', 'When ranking search results, Algolia ', ' so that it doesn’t override the textual, business, or merchandising relevance you’ve already set up. Even so, you can also change the overall impact Personalization plays. Please refer to the guide on ', ' for more information on setting the impact of events, facets, and Personalization as a whole.', 'You can enable Personalization as an index setting or at query time via the ', ' setting.

This would include keeping track of the clusters and their different application ids, and which users are on which clusters. And you would also be moving data from one machine to another, to balance the load or when adding new clusters. Algolia’s MCM makes this easy for you. All you need to do is tell the MCM API on which unique attribute you wish to split your data (here, the email of the user), and then make sure that all indexing and search operations contain the appropriate user attribute (essentially, every index record needs to include the email). The rest is easily managed with the API - cluster management, index and search mapping, and ', '.', 'Managing user emails is only one use case. We envision others.', 'Essentially, MCM comes into play whenever a set of data can be logically split into smaller chunks, such that a full search can be performed on only one chunk at a time. Let’s look at that in more detail.', 'MCM does not enable searching across clusters, nor does it merge results from different clusters. The distribution is based on a split where a user’s entire dataset can be placed on a single cluster, so that only one cluster is actually needed to perform the complete search. MCM does not, in other words, aggregate results from different clusters.', 'This works perfectly well for an email system, because users have exclusive access to their own data. In contrast, consider an online library that enables full-text book searching. You couldn’t spread the books on different servers and expect complete results from a single-cluster search. You would need to search all of the clusters and then aggregate the results.', 'One of the natural consequences of splitting up your data is that the split will not always stay balanced - some users will have significantly more data than others. MCM simplifies load balancing. You will base your initial cluster distribution on current usage; but over time, as usage grows, the initial balance will get undone. With MCM, it will be easy for you to move your user data around to sustain a balanced state.', 'Just to reiterate how MCM works:', 'Some important points:', 'As mentioned above in the ', ', clusters can have the same data as well as different data. This is seen when you allow users to search public data (music collection, public playlists) as well as private data (private playlists).', 'Private data is managed by setting the UserID parameter to a particular UserID.', 'With MCM, adding and managing ', ' across every index is as easy as setting the UserID parameter to “*”.', 'Prior to implementing MCM, every Algolia cluster is assigned a unique application id. So, customers who currently use multiple clusters need to keep track of which application id maps to which cluster. Additionally, they need to keep track of which user is on which cluster. Therefore, to manage multiple clusters, they have keep a mapping table of 3 items - user, cluster, and application id. Every indexing and search operation needs to go through this mapping.', 'With MCM, the clusters in a multi-clusters configuration use the same application id. For the mapping, every cluster contains the mapping. The customer only needs to send Algolia the user-id, and then Algolia will do the necessary redirection to find the correct cluster.', 'The way this works concretely is that there is at most ', ' clusters involved in every search: The first cluster - normally the one closest to the user - will either be the correct cluster for that user, or it will redirect the request to the correct cluster using its local map.', 'MCM is easily scalable because every cluster is independent from a data point of view: your data is broken up into as many clusters as you need, and every search is performed on its own cluster.', 'Moving data from one cluster to another (for load balancing or adding new clusters) is a simple process. Without MCM, moving data requires a number of very precise steps in the right order to avoid any downtime. Additionally, bringing in new clusters requires a number of move operations that is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Error handling and rollbacks can be difficult.', 'One of the primary goals for MCM was to simplify this process of moving data and adding new clusters, by minimizing the number of API calls and parameters you would need to use.
